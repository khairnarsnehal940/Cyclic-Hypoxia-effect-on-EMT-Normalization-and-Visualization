# volcano-plot
This GitHub repository hosts an R-script that generates a volcano plot for single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of gene sets, a popular tool in genomics for visualizing the correlation and significance of gene expression changes between two biological conditions. 
This is a GitHub repository for a R-script that generates a volcano plot for correlation and p-value of single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of gene sets. The volcano plot is a widely used visualization tool in genomics to represent the correlation and significance of gene expression changes between two biological conditions.
The script takes as input a XLSX file containing gene expression data for two different conditions, and a gene set file in the GMT format. The output is a high-quality volcano plot that displays the correlation coefficient on the x-axis and the -log10(p-value) on the y-axis. The user can also specify additional parameters, such as the color scheme and size of the plot points, and the significance threshold for identifying differentially enriched gene sets.
The script is written in R and uses popular libraries such readr,ggplot2,xlsx,dplyr. It is designed to be highly customizable and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines for gene set enrichment analysis and visualization.
This repository also includes example input files and a tutorial on how to use the script to generate a volcano plot for ssGSEA of gene sets. Contributions and feedback are welcome, and users are encouraged to report any issues or suggest improvements.
